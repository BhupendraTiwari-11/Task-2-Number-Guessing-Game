# Task-2-Number-Guessing-Game
This repository features a simple command-line Number Guessing Game built in Python. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and players try to guess the correct number with hints provided after each guess such as "Too high" or "Too low". The program also tracks the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
